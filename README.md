# CLA test repo (for code projects)

This is a test repo as we prepare to enable the CLA. Any PRs against this repo will kick off the signature flow. If you or your organization plan to be a regular contributor, please open a PR against this file. 

Please note there is a separate CLA for contributions to specification projects that also includes OWFa. If you plan to contribute to specification projects, you should also open a test PR against https://github.com/chipsalliance/CLA-test-code_spec.

Once you have signed as an individual or been added to your company's approved contributors list you will not be prompted to sign the CLA again.
